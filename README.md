# devops_portfolio ☁☁☁
The project was created to demonstrate the portfolio in the form of a website.

The project will be used to publish on the Azure portal using Azure Web Apps. 
I will use Jenkins and Github to implement the cd execution. Using this method, webhooks and Jenkins jobs will be applied.
An Azure Terraform Jenkins pipeline example will also be presented.
